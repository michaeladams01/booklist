              author Orson Scott Card. Set in Earth's future, the novel presents an

              alien species. In preparation for an anticipated third invasion,
              children, including the novel's protagonist, Ender Wiggin, are trained
               from a very young age through increasingly difficult games including

              where planetary dynasties are controlled by noble houses that owe an
              allegiance to the imperial House Corrino, Dune tells the story of young
              Paul Atreides (the heir apparent to Duke Leto Atreides and heir of
              House Atreides) as he and his family accept control of the desert planet
              Arrakis, the only source of the 'spice' melange, the most important
              and valuable substance in the cosmos. The story explores the complex,
              multi-layered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology,
              and human emotion as the forces of the empire confront each other
              for control of Arrakis.</td>

            <td>Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, Nineteen Eighty-Four
              is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory
               becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political
               satirist George Orwell's nightmare vision of a totalitarian,
               bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality.
               The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life--the
               ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language--and his
               ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required
               reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the
               most terrifying novels ever written.</td>

              Through clever use of genetic engineering, brainwashing and recreational
              sex and drugs, all its members are happy consumers. Bernard Marx seems
              alone harbouring an ill-defined longing to break free. A visit to one
              of the few remaining Savage Reservations, where the old, imperfect life
              still continues, may be the cure for his distress...</td>

              science of psychohistory, can see into the future -- to a dark age of
              ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years.
              To preserve knowledge and save mankind, Seldon gathers the best minds
               in the Empire -- both scientists and scholars -- and brings them to
               a bleak planet at the edge of the Galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope
               for a future generations. He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.</td>
