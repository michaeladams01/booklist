              Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand
              experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across
              the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities
              that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and
              inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and
              sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead,
              hell of that dreadful time. "World War Z" is the result. Never before have we had
              access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and
              also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped
              human society through the plague years. </td>

                 are much more likely to kill him first.But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet.
